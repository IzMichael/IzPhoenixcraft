                <p>In Season 4, Transport for Phoenix is bringing a new design for the PRN. This new
                    design uses easier to gather resources to simplify the construction process, and brings a new level
                    of variety to different areas of the track and stations. Stations will have a set of base
                    requirements, which would mostly be the redstone and logistical mechanics, but the overall design of
                    a station is open to creativity.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">New Mechanics:</h3>
                <p>Sponsor a Station:<br>Anyone will be able to pay a small fee and sponsor a station. Station Sponsors
                    will be able to choose the pre-name of the station, along with the ability to advertise a business
                    or project inside the station.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Direct Lines:<br>There will be all new Direct Lines between 2-5 stations, such as Spawn-Shopping
                    District and Spawn-End Portal.</p>
